To establish a connection with a database, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the default configuration file location. By default, it runs MySQL. Find the file at:

   ```
   C:\Program Files\apache-tomcat-9.0.56\webapps\identityiq\WEB-lNF\classes\iiq.properties
   ```

2. In the `iiq.properties` file, locate and modify the following lines:

   ```properties
   dataSource.username= <Database_username>
   dataSource.password= <Database_password>
   ```

   Replace `<Database_username>` and `<Database_password>` with your actual database credentials.

3. For projects within your organization, update the database connection information from:

   ```plaintext
   localhost:3306
   ```

   to the IP address or DNS of your machine.

By following these steps, you ensure that your application is configured to connect to the correct database with the specified credentials. This is essential for the proper functioning of your application's database interactions.
